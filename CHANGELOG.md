# Changelog

# Unreleased
### Changed
- template.spec and the files created by pyp2spec are relicensed under MIT-0 (No attribution) license


# [0.5.0] - 2022-06-15
### Changed
- Clearly state in version that project is in the alpha maturity phase,
its API may be subject of change

# [0.4.0] - 2022-05-23
### Added
- It's possible to declare archful package via CLI (`--archful, -a`) -
the generated spec file will not contain `BuildArch: noarch` line
- Package version compatible with PEP 440 is now converted to RPM scheme,
version not following the specification remains unchanged.
For that, a modified part of [pyreq2rpm](https://github.com/gordonmessmer/pyreq2rpm/blob/master/pyreq2rpm/pyreq2rpm.py) is used

### Changed
- Requirement to generate the runtime requirements is no longer passed as an `-r` flag,
this was made the default option as of pyproject-rpm-macros 0-53
- Sources are no longer enumerated as per [this change](https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/pull-request/1157) in Fedora's Packaging Guidelines

### Fixed
- CLI `--spec-output` option has got a short version `-o`. `-s` is valid for `--summary`


## [0.3.3] - 2022-01-11
### Fixed
- Prevent creating spec file without summary (fill in placeholder `...`)
- Prevent creating spec file with multiline summary value (fill in placeholder `...`)
- Don't create a spec file when the upstream `license` field contains the whole license text instead of the keyword - error and end the program.
- Add a comment in the generated spec file that the `description` field should be filled in by the packager
- Created spec files now contain a newline at the end of file


## [0.3.2] - 2021-12-10
### Fixed
- If no `project_urls` are present in the package data, fall back to `package_url`
which always lists the PyPI package URL


## [0.3.1] - 2021-12-09
### Fixed
- When sdist is in `zip` format, it %{pypi_source} is now correctly called with all arguments: name, version and format


## [0.3.0] - 2021-12-08
### Added
- `zip` is recognized as a valid sdist format and used to create source macro
- Description lines are now wrapped at 79 characters, so they don't annoy rpmlint
- `MANIFEST.in` to include tests in sdist

### Fixed
- Cassettes were reloaded so that tests don't send real HTTP requests
- 'OSI Approved' License classifier is ignored now, it's a top-level category
that doesn't bring any meaningful information


## [0.2.0] - 2021-11-29
### Added
- Explicit comment in template.spec that "'*' +auto" is not allowed in Fedora
- Command-line option `--top-level` to filter only top-level modules during the check phase

### Changed
- Proprietary licenses are declared as "BAD" for Fedora, not "UNKNOWN"
- Minor README corrections


## [0.1.0] - 2021-11-19
