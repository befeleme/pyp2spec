# pyp2spec

This project is a thought descendant of [specfile_generator](https://github.com/frenzymadness/specfile_generator).

It generates working Fedora RPM spec file for Python projects.
The produced spec files must be compliant with the current [Python Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/) (in effect since 2021).
It utilizes the benefits of [pyproject-rpm-macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros).

## What it does

`pyp2spec` gathers all the necessary information from PyPI to produce a valid
Fedora spec file and stores it in the current directory alongside with
the config file used to produce the spec file.

Inside, there are two parts:
- *pyp2conf*: gathers of all the necessary information to produce a spec file and stores it in a configuration file
- *conf2spec*: produces working spec file using all the information from configuration file

## How to run

To run whatever this project offers at this point,
install package `pyp2spec` from PyPI with the command:
```
pip install pyp2spec
```
Then you can run:
```
pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```
or those two commands which will together produce the same result as `pyp2spec`:
```
pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
conf2spec <config_file>
```

To see all available command-line options, run `--help` with the respective commands.

## Development

Alternatively, you can clone the project from GitHub and install
the dependencies to you virtual environment:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the script and generate both the config and spec file, type:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```

You can run either of the tools separately to generate partial results:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
python -m pyp2spec.conf2spec <config_file>
```

### Tests

Test framework used in the project is pytest.
The tests use pytest-regressions extension used to generate spec files to compare.
The tests use betamax to record API calls and replay them from the prerecorded cassettes.
To run the tests, run following commands:

```
python -m pip install pytest pytest-regressions betamax
python -m pytest -vv
```

## Configuration file specification

Configuration data is stored in a TOML file.
