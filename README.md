# pyp2spec

This project is a thought descendant of [specfile_generator](https://github.com/frenzymadness/specfile_generator).

It generates working Fedora RPM spec file for Python projects.
The produced spec files must be compliant with the current [Python Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/) (in effect since 2021).
It utilizes the benefits of [pyproject-rpm-macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros).

This project's maturity state is alpha.
Its API may be a subject of change.

## What it does

`pyp2spec` gathers all the necessary information from PyPI to produce a valid
Fedora spec file and stores it in the current directory alongside with
the config file used to produce the spec file.

Inside, there are two parts:
- *pyp2conf*: gathers of all the necessary information to produce a spec file and stores it in a configuration file
- *conf2spec*: produces working spec file using all the information from configuration file

## How to run

To run whatever this project offers at this point,
install package `pyp2spec` from PyPI with the command:
```
pip install pyp2spec
```
Then you can run:
```
pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```
or those two commands which will together produce the same result as `pyp2spec`:
```
pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
conf2spec <config_file>
```

To see all available command-line options, run `--help` with the respective commands.

## Development

Alternatively, you can clone the project from GitHub and install
the dependencies to you virtual environment:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the script and generate both the config and spec file, type:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```

You can run either of the tools separately to generate partial results:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
python -m pyp2spec.conf2spec <config_file>
```

### Tests

To run the tests, run [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/index.html):

```
tox
```

You can install `tox` from your OS repository or PyPI.
Test dependencies are defined in the project's `[test]` extra.


## Configuration file specification

Configuration data is stored in a TOML file.
