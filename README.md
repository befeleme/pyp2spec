# pyp2spec

This project is a thought descendant of [specfile_generator](https://github.com/frenzymadness/specfile_generator).

It generates working Fedora RPM spec file for Python projects.
The produced spec files must be compliant with the current [Python Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/) (in effect since 2021).
It utilizes the benefits of [pyproject-rpm-macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros).

This project's maturity state is alpha.
Its API may be a subject of change.

## What it does

`pyp2spec` gathers all the necessary information from PyPI to produce a valid
Fedora spec file and stores it in the current directory alongside with
the config file used to produce the spec file.

Inside, there are two parts:
- *pyp2conf*: gathers of all the necessary information to produce a spec file and stores it in a configuration file
- *conf2spec*: produces working spec file using all the information from configuration file

### Standard mode

pyp2spec attempts to detect all unambiguous information from the package
metadata, but avoids applying complicated heuristics to provide *at least
somewhat accurate* results.
In the standard mode it generates files with all the detected information which
may not be enough to generate a valid RPM immediately. There are placeholders
in the fields that couldn't be determined automatically which are left for
the packager to fill in.
The generated spec contains comments helping to locate the missing pieces.
This is the default mode of pyp2spec.

### Automode

Automode, invoked with `--automode` or `-a` command-line options,
is the preferred way of generating spec files in the automated environments.
It sets the convenient defaults that increase the chance of creating a buildable package.
The defaults:
- import check attempts to import the the top-level modules only
  (since importing all of the detected modules can fail on e.g. OS-related dependencies)
- all the found license names are validated as existing SPDX identifiers and
  checked for compliance with Fedora Legal data - the script warns about
  the incorrectness but creates a spec file anyways
- the license string, if not a valid SPDX expression already, is a combination
  of all detected identifiers joined with the "AND" operator

The generated spec files don't fulfill all the necessities of the official
Fedora packages and hence cannot be submitted for review.

## How to run

To run whatever this project offers at this point,
install package `pyp2spec` from PyPI with the command:
```
pip install pyp2spec
```
Then you can run:
```
pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```
or those two commands which will together produce the same result as `pyp2spec`:
```
pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
conf2spec <config_file>
```

To see all available command-line options, run `--help` with the respective commands.

## Development

Alternatively, you can clone the project from GitHub and install
the dependencies to you virtual environment:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the script and generate both the config and spec file, type:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2spec <pypi_package_name>
```

You can run either of the tools separately to generate partial results:
```
python -m pyp2spec.pyp2conf <pypi_package_name>
python -m pyp2spec.conf2spec <config_file>
```

### Tests

To run the tests, run [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/index.html):

```
tox
```

You can install `tox` from your OS repository or PyPI.
Test dependencies are defined in the project's `[test]` extra.


## Configuration file specification

Configuration data is stored in a TOML file.

### Fields generated by pyp2conf


| Field  | Description | Type |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| pypi_name | package name as stored in PyPI  | string   |
| python_name | pypi_name prepended with `python-` and alternative Python version, if `python_alt_version` is defined| string |
| pypi_version | package version string as on PyPI | string
| summary | short package summary | string |
| license | license name | string |
| url | project URL | string |
| source | source of the sdist tarball, currently only "PyPI" supported | string |
| extras | extra subpackages names | list of strings |
| archful | package contains compiled extensions, implies not using `BuildArch: noarch` and adding `BuildRequires: gcc` | bool |
| python_alt_version | specific Python version to create the spec file for, e.g. 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 | string |
| automode | create buildable spec files that don't have to fully comply with Fedora Guidelines; useful for automatic build environments | bool |
| license_files_present | `License-File` field was detected in the package metadata | bool |


### Example config file generated by pyp2spec

```
license = "MIT"
archful = false
summary = "A simple Python 3 library for Notion Home Monitoring"
pypi_version = "2024.3.1"
pypi_name = "aionotion"
python_name = "python-aionotion"
url = "https://github.com/bachya/aionotion"
source = "PyPI"
extras = []
license_files_present = true
```
